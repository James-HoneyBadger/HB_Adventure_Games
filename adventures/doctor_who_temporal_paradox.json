  "intro": "\"Brilliant! Fantastic! Allons-y!\"\n\nThe TARDIS materializes with its characteristic wheeze-groan. You are the\nDoctor - the last of the Time Lords, traveler of time and space in a stolen\nType 40 TARDIS that's bigger on the inside.\n\nYou've detected a MASSIVE temporal disturbance - reality itself is fracturing!\nMultiple time periods are colliding. Ancient Earth, Victorian London, far-future\nspace stations, and alien worlds are bleeding into each other.\n\nYour instruments point to four Time Crystals - artifacts of immense power that\nsomebody is using to rewrite history. The Daleks? The Cybermen? The Master?\n\nYou must:\n- Explore four distinct time periods\n- Recruit companions to help you\n- Solve complex puzzles with your sonic screwdriver\n- Face iconic enemies (Daleks, Cybermen, Weeping Angels, The Silence)\n- Collect the four Time Crystals\n- Uncover the mastermind's identity\n- Save all of reality!\n\n\"Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff. I'm good at that. LET'S GO!\"\n\n(This adventure features: 60+ rooms, branching quests, companion AI, regeneration\nmechanic, multiple endings, and complex puzzle chains. Welcome to the ultimate\nDoctor Who experience!)",
