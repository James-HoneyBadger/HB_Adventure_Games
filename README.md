## 🎮 Sample Gameplay

```
=== THE DARK TOWER ===
by Honey Badger Universe

You stand at the entrance of a foreboding tower. Dark clouds 
swirl overhead, and a chill wind howls through the stone archway.
A rusted iron door stands to the north.

Exits: north
Items: torch
NPCs: none

> get torch
You take the wooden torch. It flickers to life in your hand.

> go north
You push through the heavy door...

The Great Hall stretches before you, lit by flickering torches.
Ancient tapestries hang from the walls, depicting battles long 
forgotten. A guard stands at attention near the far door.

Exits: north, south, east
Items: none
NPCs: guard

> talk to guard
Guard: "Halt! State your business in the Dark Tower!"

> examine guard
A stern-looking guard in burnished chainmail. He grips a 
longsword with practiced ease.

> attack guard
The guard readies his weapon!

You hit the guard for 8 damage.
The guard strikes you for 5 damage.
```
